# Rmbd Dev Kit

This directory contains tools for doing development on rmbd itself. It is for use by the developers of rmbd, and is not for use by users of it, and does not ship with the project distribution.

The whole thing about this directory is that it doesn't care about name collisions in its class and function names; it assumes that rmbd is the only thing you're working on in your session. It names functions whatever it wants, and doesn't put them inside packages. (This is intentional, to make it convenient for rmbd developers to call them without having to type out the package name all the time.) So it is _not_ suitable for redistribution to users.


## Naming Rule 

Rule-Based Word Shortening Algorithm
1 Remove all vowels, except the first one if needed for readability. 
2 Keep the first and last consonants intact.
3 Reduce double consonants into a single letter (e.g., Process ? Prcs). 
4 Maintain phonetic recognition so the shortened word remains understandable.
5 Keep critical letters that define meaning (e.g., Calibration ? Clbrtn).
