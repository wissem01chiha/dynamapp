Key Features That Make Reactis Powerful
Automated Test Generation

Reactis can automatically generate test suites that thoroughly exercise a model.

It ensures high coverage, including MC/DC (Modified Condition/Decision Coverage).

Runtime Error Detection

Identifies issues like overflow errors, divide-by-zero errors, and other runtime faults.

Helps engineers catch bugs early in the development process.

Coverage Tracking & Debugging

Tracks statement, decision, condition, and MC/DC coverage.

Provides breakpoints, scopes, and reverse execution for debugging.

Functional Testing & Requirement Validation

Allows users to check whether a model violates its requirements.

Helps ensure compliance with ISO 26262 and Automotive SPICE standards.

Back-to-Back Testing

Compares model-generated outputs with software-generated outputs to ensure accuracy.

Automatically detects and flags differences.

C Code Testing & Analysis

Reactis for C Plugin enables white-box analysis of C code portions in models.

Supports S-Functions, C Caller blocks, and custom code debugging.

Reverse Engineering & Model Inspection

Helps engineers understand legacy models and reverse-engineer them.

Offers a low-cost Simulink viewer for inspecting models.
